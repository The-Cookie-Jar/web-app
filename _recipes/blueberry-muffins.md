ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour or whole wheat pastry flour
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1 teaspoon cinnamon
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1 cup shredded zucchini, squeezed of excess moisture with a paper towel
  - 1/2 cup pure maple syrup
  - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce (or apple butter)
  - 1 egg
  - 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
  - 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12 cup muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray or line with muffin liners. Either way I recommend using non-stick cooking spray. This guarantees that they muffins will not stick to the liners or the pan.
  - In a large bowl combine the dry ingredients flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; set aside.
  - In a separate medium bowl, add the following wet ingredients shredded zucchini, pure maple syrup, vanilla and almond extract, olive oil, applesauce, egg and milk; mix until well combined. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Gently fold in blueberries.
  - Even distribute batter among muffin tins, filling about 3/4 of the way full. Bake for 22-30 minutes or until toothpick inserted into the middle of the muffin comes out clean. Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes then remove muffins and transfer to wire rack to finish cooling. Makes 12 muffins.
