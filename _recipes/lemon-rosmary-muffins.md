  - 2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 1/3 cup olive oil, melted

  - Whisk the flour, sugar, lemon zest, chopped rosemary, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.
  - Add olive oil, mashed banana, room temp almond milk, vanilla and lemon extract, to a bowl and whisk until smooth. If the mixture is too cold and oil begins to solidify, simply pop in the microwave for a few seconds.
  - Add wet to dry ingredient lightly combine. Do not over mix. (The muffin batter will be quite thick) Fill into the muffin cups and top with coarse sugar (optional).
  - Bake for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick is inserted in the middle and comes out clean. If the tops are browning too much, simply turn down the heat to 375 for the remaining bake.
  - Icing, combine the powdered sugar and lemon juice and adjust to create the desired consistency. Drizzle over top and garnish with lemon zest.
