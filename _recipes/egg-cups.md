ingredients:
  - 1 cup chickpea flour
  - 1/2 cup lite coconut milk or other non-dairy milk
  - 3/4 cup water
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
  - 1 tsp mustard
  - 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric
  - 1/4 tsp baking powder
  - 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/2 tsp onion powder
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - Optional ingredients
  - Vegan breakfast sausage
  - Vegan cheese, for topping
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 450F, grease a muffin tin and set aside.
  - In a medium bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour, coconut milk and water until well combined.
  - Add in remaining ingredients and mix well.
  - Divide the saut√©ed veggies evenly between muffin tins then do the same for the chickpea flour egg mixture. These won't really rise so fill the muffin cups almost to the top. You should fill get about 6 - 8 cavities.
  - Use a fork or knife to stir the veggies and batter together so the veggies aren't all settled at the bottom then top with vegan cheese, if desired.
  - Bake for 15 minutes then lower the temperature to 430F and bake for another 10 - 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the muffins comes out clean.
  - Allow to cool for a few minutes, then carefully run a knife around the edges and remove the egg cups from the tin. Be very gentle as they can be fragile when still warm.
  - Serve immediately or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, before storing in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
