ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup plain almond milk
  - Zest of 1 organic lemon + 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
  - 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for sprinkling
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
  - 1/4 cup coconut oil, solid
  - 1 cup blueberries
  - 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
  - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 375Â° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, lightly dust with flour, and set it aside.
  - In a small bowl, whisk together the almond milk and lemon juice to make vegan buttermilk. Allow to sit for 5 minutes.
  - In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the coconut oil, using your hands to pinch it into the flour (pea sized or smaller pieces is ideal). Gently fold the blueberries into the flour mixture.
  - Make a well in the center and add in the vegan buttermilk, lemon zest, maple syrup, and vanilla. Stir until a slightly sticky, very thick dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough.
  - Transfer the dough to your prepared baking sheet. Lightly dust it with flour, then form it into an 8-inch round and cut into 8 parts. Bake for 23-28 minutes, or until golden. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean. Allow the scones to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
  - While the scones cool, make the glaze. In a small mixing bowl, stir together the powdered sugar and almond milk until no lumps remain. Drizzle the scones with the glaze and serve.
