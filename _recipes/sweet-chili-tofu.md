ingredients:
  - 2 blocks extra firm tofu (around 240g each), sliced into cubes
  - 1 heaping tbsp cornstarch
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/2 cup bell pepper, sliced into squares
  - 2 tbsp sesame oil, for frying
  - Onion leeks, chopped
  - Sweet Chili Sauce, 6 cloves garlic, minced
  - Sweet Chili Sauce, 1/2 tbsp cornstarch
  - Sweet Chili Sauce, 2 tbsp coconut sugar
  - Sweet Chili Sauce, 1 1/2 tbsp maple syrup
  - Sweet Chili Sauce, 2 tsp chili sauce (like sriracha)
  - Sweet Chili Sauce, 1/8 cup soy sauce
  - Sweet Chili Sauce, 2 tsp sesame oil

steps:
  - Dry the tofu and cut into cubes. I wrap the tofu in towels and place a plate on top of it until excess liquid is absorbed by the towels.
  - Sprinkle the salt on the tofu cubes. Add the cornstarch. Coat the tofu well.
  - In a bowl, mix all the ingredients for the sauce.
  - In a pan, heat around 1 1/2 tbsp of oil and then fry the tofu cubes until crisp and golden. You may need to turn around the tofu cubes.
  - Take out the tofu and saut√© the onion leeks and bell peppers in a little oil.
  - Add in the tofu, sauce, and then mix well. The sauce will thicken from the corn starch.
