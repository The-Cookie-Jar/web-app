  - 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp flour
  - 2 cups cornflakes

  - Tortilla wraps
  - BBQ Sauce
  - Wrap fillings lettuce, onions, carrots
steps:
  - In a frying pan on medium heat add a few tbsp of oil (I used coconut oil).
  - In bowl number 1 whisk together your 1/2 cup non-dairy milk, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp Dijon mustard and 2 tbsp flour.
  - In bowl number 2 add your 1/2 cup flour.
  - In bowl number 3 add your corn flakes and with your hand crush up the cereal to a finer crumb.
  - Slice up your tofu into “fingers” and dip first in the wet mixture (bowl number 1), then dry (bowl number 2), then wet again (bowl number 1), then corn flakes (bowl number 3).
  - Place your breaded tofu into the oil and fry until crispy and golden.
  - Toss your fried tofu pieces in your BBQ sauce and assemble your wraps.
