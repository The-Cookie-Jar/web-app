ingredients:
  - 250 g wheat flour
  - 15 g of baking powder
  - 8 g vanilla sugar
  - Pinch of salt
  - 120 g of soy quark
  - 40 g of sugar
  - 250 ml of vegetable milk
  - A little coconut oil
steps:
  - First put the flour in a mixing bowl.
  - Add the baking powder, vanilla sugar, sugar and salt.
  - Now put the quark and the plant milk in the mixing bowl and stir everything with a hand mixer to a smooth dough.
  - Cover, set aside and let rise for 15 minutes.
  - Now heat the oil in a saucepan and bake the pancakes on low heat. If the pancakes throw bubbles and can be easily detached from the pan, then they can be turned.
  - To bake uniform pancakes, I use a 1/3 cup for portioning.
