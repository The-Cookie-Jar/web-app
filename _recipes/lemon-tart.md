ingredients:
  - For the Crust
  - 1 3/4 cup almond flour
  - 3 pitted Medjool dates
  - 3 Tbsp coconut oil
  - 1 Tbsp lemon juice
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - For the Filling
  - 1 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked overnight (or soak 1-2 hours in freshly boiled water)
  - 1/2 cup full fat coconut milk
  - Zest of 3 lemons
  - 1/2 cup lemon juice
  - 1/3 cup pure maple syrup
  - 1/4 cup melted coconut oil
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - For the Coconut Whipped Cream
  - 1 14-oz. can full fat coconut milk, refrigerated overnight
  - 1 Tbsp pure maple syrup
steps:
  - The night before, refrigerate 1 can of coconut milk.  Soak the cashews in cool water and refrigerate overnight.  If you forget to soak the cashews, then on the day you're making the tart, bring a small pot of water to a boil.  Remove from heat and pour the hot water over the cashews; soak 1-2 hours then drain.
  - The day of, preheat the oven to 350.  To make the crust, place the almond flour, dates, coconut oil, lemon juice, and salt into a food processor.  Pulse several times until the mixture resembles wet sand.  It will be a bit sticky.  Pour the crust mixture into a lightly greased tart pan, pressing firmly.  Make sure to press some of the mixture up the sides of the pan.  Using a fork, poke holes at least every square inch into the bottom of the pan.  Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes until fragrant.  Remove and cool completely.
  - Place the cashews, coconut milk, lemon zest, lemon juice, maple syrup, coconut oil, and salt into a high-powered blender.  Blend, scraping down the sides as needed, until creamy.  Pour this mixture into the cooled crust, spreading evenly with a spatula.  Refrigerate 2 hours or until set.
  - To make the coconut whipped cream, scoop the hardened coconut cream out from the can of refrigerated coconut milk.  Place it into a bowl with the maple syrup.  Blend using a hand mixer.  You can add a little of the leftover coconut water if needed to help the mixture come together.  Only add a tablespoon at a time.
  - When the tart is set, gently spread the coconut whipped cream over top.  Garnish with lemon zest.  Chill until ready to serve.
